# Design for Testability

## Intent
Design components so important behavior can be exercised in isolation or through controlled boundaries without invasive setup.

## When to apply
Apply this skill when the current task, code review, design change, incident, test strategy, or engineering-process decision materially involves this concern. First establish the concrete problem; do not invoke the skill only because its terminology appears in the task.

## Procedure
1. State the concrete engineering problem and desired outcome.
2. Inspect the relevant code, architecture, tests, data flow, or team/process context.
3. Choose the smallest change or practice that addresses the observed problem.
4. Verify both the intended result and the important side effects or trade-offs.

## Decision rules
- Prefer the smallest intervention that addresses the observed problem.
- Make assumptions and trade-offs explicit when they materially affect the decision.
- Preserve existing behavior unless the task explicitly requires a behavior change.
- Prefer evidence from the codebase, tests, measurements, and system constraints over personal preference.

## Anti-patterns
- Apply the guidance as a mechanical rule without examining context.
- Introduce complexity without demonstrating the problem it solves.

## Exceptions and trade-offs
- Use project constraints, language/runtime capabilities, risk, and lifecycle to adapt the practice.

## Verification
- Verify the affected behavior with the narrowest reliable automated checks available.
- Inspect the resulting structure for unnecessary complexity or new coupling.
- For system-level changes, verify operational and integration consequences, not only local correctness.
